									<p>The 1980s revealed that some Meteor Showers weren't produced by active mass-shedding comets, but some were produced by now-dormant comets and others still were produced by objects that otherwise appear like unremarkable asteroids. Characterizing the "parent bodies" of Meteor Showers -- how they reflect light, how their orbits are evolving, and if they can be matched to meteorites -- is a key path towards understanding how they actually produced their Showers, but only if their properties can be compared against a control sample of now-dormant comets.</p>
									<p>Our 2018 paper detailing rotationally-resolved spectroscopy of Geminid parent and space mission target (3200) Phaethon is available <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11157">here</a>, our 2021 paper detailing the visible reflectance and thermal history of Quadrantid parent (196256) 2003 EH1 <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PSJ.....2...31K/abstract">here</a>, and the first spectra of Daytime Sextantid parent (155140) 2005 UD and new laboratory work to understand its relationship with Phaethon can be found <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PSJ.....2..190K/abstract">here</a>.</p>
									<h2 id="meteors">Cometary Aging and Dormancy</h2>
									<p>Understanding what it actually means for comets to be "dormant" (no longer active and shedding material) is not just useful to understanding a handful of odd meteor showers, but is one of the central areas of research in the study of the life cycle of comets. How do comets slowly losing their ice supplies change their other properties -- like the patterns of their activity or the albedo and reflectivity of their nuclei?</p>
									<p>Our 2022 paper detailing the last days of activity on near-Earth comet P/2016 BA14 (PANSTARRS) can be read <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PSJ.....3..105K/abstract">here</a>, our 2023 paper detailing near-infrared imaging and spectroscopy of formerly hyper-active comet 46P/Wirtanen is available <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023PSJ.....4...85K/abstract">here</a>, and our 2023 paper describing the origins of classic comet-asteroid transition object 107P/Wilson-Harrington is available here <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230808659K/abstract">here.</a></p>

									<p>Comets might finally go dormant in the Inner Solar System, but they first become active and begin developing atmospheres much further out. The Centaurs are small solar system bodies on chaotic Giant-Planet-crossing orbits in the middle and outer solar system. They're primarily sourced by the Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) and are in turn the primary source of the Jupiter Family Comets (JFCs), and thus act as a link between the two icy populations. A small fraction of the centaurs become active like comets at distances too far from the Sun -- and thus too cold -- for the sublimation of water ice to be creating their comae and tails.</p>
									<p>We obtained visible and near-infrared observations of Echeclus just days after the onset of its second largest outburst ever in December 2017. Synthesizing these multiple wavelength observations faciliatated a more in-depth understanding of the dust properties of Echeclus as well as showed clear evidence for a debris-ejection event analogous to much weaker version of the 2005 fragmentation event. However, a new high-resolution orbital integration reveals no evidence for a recent large change in orbit thought to fuel activity in many centaurs. This work was published in the Astronomical Journal as <strong>"Physical Characterization of the 2017 December Outburst of the Centaur 174P/Echeclus" (Kareta et al., 2019)</strong> and is available <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ab505f">here</a> at AJ and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09490">here</a> on ArXiV. One takeaway is that if Echeclus's explosive activity is at all representative of the centaurs, then there may be other fragmentation / debris-ejection events happening on other centaurs that are going unnoticed.</p>

                                                                        <p>The discovery of the first-ever (unambiguous) interstellar comet, <strong>2I/Borisov</strong>, presented an obvious in-road to investigating questions at the bridge of planetary science and astronomy, like "How do other stellar systems compare to our own?" or "Are planets and planetesimals built the same everywhere?" Beyond that, it was a chance to study a comet that formed <i>elsewhere.</i> (When I gave a SpaceDrafts talk on the topic, I framed it as "Is stuff out there like stuff here?")</p>
									<p>We obtained observations of this interstellar visitor from the middle of September through early December 2019 using some of the University of Arizona's telescopes (2.3m Bok, 6.5m MMT, 2 x 8.4m LBT) to constrain not just what material was being lofted off the surface of the comet, but how this evolved in time. A preliminary reduction of a subset of the data was published in February 2020 in the Astrophysical Journal Letters as <strong>"Carbon Chain Depletion of 2I/Borisov" (Kareta et al., 2020)</strong> which is available <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab6a08">here</a> at ApJL and <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1910/1910.03222.pdf">here</a> on ArXiV. We were able to set an incredibly low C2/CN ratio in early October for the object, implying a composition unlike almost any Solar System comet, but later observations by other groups saw the ratio grow into a more 'normal' value, perhaps suggesting that the volatiles in 2I aren't locked up inside and released from the nucleus in the same way they are in Solar System comets. (More observations of future interstellar comets are probably needed to know how to properly interpret any observations.)
